        <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
        Housing, they say is one of the human most important needs. The need to have a place to call home, a place to
        get all the rest deserved, the peace and its quietness to help one relax, rebuild and retarget all goals and
        dreams. The real estate sector in
        Nigeria is fast growing with the inception of privately owned businesses all working closely with then
        government to ensure that housing is made available to everyone. But the question still remains that, can anyone
        and everyone own a house in
        Nigeria?

        <br />

        <br />
        <h3>THE PROBLEM</h3><br /> Understanding that housing deficit in Nigeria is fast growing as population is
        growing with regular increase in cost of land as it appreciates over time, it has thus become a thing of worries
        for individuals who want to be
        Land Owners but cannot afford it at a go or save up with necessary discipline to meet up the land appreciation
        and hence buy themselves a land. Below in summary, is a list of problems faced by individuals who dream of
        having a Land but never live
        to see this dream come through;

        <ul>
            <li>Cost of land</li>
            <li>Access to trusted real estate agencies</li>
            <li>Fear of being scammed</li>
            <li>Regular Land appreciation making their savings to never meet up with current selling price.</li>
            <li>Easy access to landed properties.</li>
        </ul><br />
        <br />
        <h4>Cost of Land</h4><br /> The fact still remains that Land has always been expensive even when measured from
        the late 90s till date. You would realize that people In those years never got to buy themselves a land and
        today we look at them and say
        “They were not serious, so land used to be that cheap and they didn’t buy any” but we forgot that what we are
        dealing with is the value of money and not the real actual cost of what we see or think we know. In the late
        90s, 20naira worth’s exactly
        what millions of naira worth’s today and only a few people had it then so definitely they all could not have
        exactly same amount of asset or access to these assets. They (those who had land and those who didn’t were all
        affected by the cost of
        land and today as the value of naira reduces, pushing up the cost of land to an amount appearing as a fortune,
        only a few people can without stress afford land leaving out a majority of the population who would have wanted
        a land of their own
        <br />
        <br />
        <h4>Access to trusted real estate agencies</h4><br /> As much as there are lots of real estate’s firms in
        Nigeria, only a few of them truly owns the property they display and only but a few even allocate the properties
        they own to clients after selling
        off. This in turn has caused a huge set back for individuals who wants a land, have the money but do not have
        access to whom to trust or deal with.
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Fear of being scammed.</h4><br /> A lot of land dreamers never make a move because of the stories they have
        heard, and or the ones they witnessed, thereby stopping them from actually bringing that dream to reality. For
        some of them it is not just
        being scammed, its them losing all their live savings, their family and even their business as some people go as
        far as investing their live savings into owning a land some even keep their family at the losing end, as they
        have to push in all
        their funds into buying the land and at the end they find out it’s all been a scam. They end up not buying that
        land.
        <br />
        <br />
        <h4>Regular Land appreciation</h4><br /> Making their savings to never meet up with current selling price. In
        the midst of people who cannot afford a land at a go, are people who have tried saving up to own a land but just
        never meet up with the selling
        price of land as it keeps appreciating with time. So they either keep saving or give up the dream of owning a
        land and spend the saved funds on other needs. In most cases the latter is always the case.
        <br />
        <br />
        <h4>Easy access to landed properties.</h4><br /> It is one thing to have access to genuine real estate firm and
        another thing to have that access to their landed properties, seamless and easy on the go. This becomes a
        problem as Nigerians are on a
        daily basis engaged with one thing or the other, some are working, in business, in school or anywhere all the
        time and never get the time and space to visit this real estate firms or even their lands to see what they can
        buy or have bought.
